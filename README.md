# LandGen
A simple project I am using to teach myself c++. The premise is simple: it uses Worley noise and some tweaks like smoothing to create a landmass complete with multiple colors, i.e. yellow-tan would represent sand, the green would be more of a grassland, while the brown is mountain ranges.
You can press space to generate more land.

Built using SFML 2.5.1... poorly, I learned a few things about the linker in this project and the way I have produced this project setup is poorly done. I.e. you have to link the library yourself if you want to compile it.
