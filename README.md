# LandGen
A simple project I am using to teach myself c++. The premise is simple: it uses Worley noise and some tweaks like smoothing to create a landmass complete with multiple colors, i.e. yellow-tan would represent sand, the green would be more of a grassland, while the brown is mountain ranges.
